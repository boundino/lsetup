% The date is in yyyy/mm/dd format. Today has been
% redefined to match, but if the date needs to be fixed, please write it in this fashion.
% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.
% For the final version it is best to "touch" the head file to make sure it has the latest date.

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. For PASs: **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: CDS MathJax processor used on the abstract doesn't understand them _and_ will only look within $$. The abstracts for papers are hand formatted so macros are okay.
\abstract{
We present a measurement of the b jet transverse momentum spectra in proton-lead (pPb) collisions from CMS using the 35 nb$^{-1}$ of data collected during the 2013 heavy-ion run at the LHC.  Jets from b quark fragmentation are found by exploiting the long lifetime of mesons containing a b quark through tagging methods using distributions of the secondary vertex mass and displacement. Extracted cross sections for b jets in pPb collisions are scaled by the number of nucleon-nucleon collisions and compared to pp cross sections obtained from {\sc pythia} simulations. This {\sc pythia}-based estimate of the nuclear modification factor is denoted $R_{\mathrm{pA}}^{\mathrm{PYTHIA}}$ and is found be 1.22$\pm$0.04(stat.)$\pm$0.22(syst.).  The nominal value larger than unity seems to suggest a small enhancement of yield in pPb as compared to {\sc pythia}, but is consistent with unity within systematic uncertainties. We also compare this result to predictions from models using perturbative QCD calculations.

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text:
% (1) no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
% (2) no %.
% (3) No curly braces {}.
